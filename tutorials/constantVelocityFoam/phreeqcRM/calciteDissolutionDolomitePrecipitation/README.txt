Case study: Calcite dissolution considering kinetic reactions and Dolomite precipitation with phase equilibrium - with no porosity feedback

test case described in Pavuluri et al. (2022?), see Case 2

Phreeqc test setup:
The phreeqc run file is available in 'constant/phreeqcRun.phr'

To run the phreeqc file:
$phreeqc phreeqcRun.phr phreeqcRun.log

The output of the phreeqc run is written to a file named 'CalciteDissDoloPrecip.op' 

The output data used in the plots is available in 'plots/*'
